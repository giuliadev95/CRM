# HOW I CREATED THE PROEJCTS


## BACKEND

0. install dependencies in package.json
1. initialize server
2. add controllers logic
3. add routes
4. test routes with Postman


### HOW I TESTED IT

- I tested the routes with Postman: you can find the json exports at this path: contactlist\backend\postman_test\contactlist project.postman_collection.json

- I'm implementing the Unit tests with Jest, while learning how to use this tool.


### ERRORS
1. WHY DO I GET AN ERROR IF ONLY NAME OR EMAIL ARE MISSING?
2. CHECK THE ERRORS STATUS CODE

### FURTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS
1. IF I UODATE CERTAIN FIELDS THE BACKEND DOESN'T PRESERVE THE OLD ONES, BUT PUTS A NULL.

    > I'D LIKE TO PRESERVE THOSE FROM THE BACKEND.
    > TILL NOW, I PRESERVE THEM ONLY WHEN UPDATING THE CONTACT FROM THE FRONTEND, BECAUSE I PRINT THE OLD VALUES IN EACH INPUT FIELD.



## FRONTEND
1. add react frontend call it "frontend"
2. organize src/components
3. organize src/pages
